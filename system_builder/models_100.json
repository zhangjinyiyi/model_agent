The model ensures adaptability through adjustable constraints and input/output connections."}, "LoopingPQ.mo": {"path": "/Users/yi/Documents/code/model_agent/ThermoSysPro/WaterSteam/LoopBreakers/LoopingPQ.mo", "description": "The Modelica model \"LoopingPQ\" is part of the ThermoSysPro.WaterSteam library, primarily designed to manage the flow and pressure in a water-steam loop. Key parameters include an absolute pressure (P) set at 1e5 Pa and a mass flow rate (Q) of 1.0 kg/s. The model features fluid inlet and outlet connectors, along with components for loop breaking, pressure loss handling, and boundary conditions for both pressure and mass flow. The equations establish connections between the components, effectively controlling the fluid's behavior within the defined boundaries, thereby allowing simulation of the system's dynamic performance."}, "LoopBreakerP.mo": {"path": "/Users/yi/Documents/code/model_agent/ThermoSysPro/WaterSteam/LoopBreakers/LoopBreakerP.mo", "description": "The Modelica model \"LoopBreakerP\" is designed as a pressure loop breaker for water/steam systems within the ThermoSysPro library. It includes two connectors, a FluidInlet (C1) and a FluidOutlet (C2), which enforce equal mass flow rates (Q) and specific enthalpies (h) between them. This model serves to manage flow reversal by setting up conditions for switching the specific enthalpy based on the direction of the flow.
