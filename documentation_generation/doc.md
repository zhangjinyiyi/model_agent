# GenericCombustion Model Documentation

## Overview

The `GenericCombustion` model simulates a generic combustion chamber. It is part of the `ThermoSysPro.Combustion.CombustionChambers` package and can be used to analyze the thermodynamics and fluid dynamics of combustive processes. The model accounts for various physical phenomena, including mass flow balance, energy balance, combustion air ratio, and pressure losses across the chamber.

## Key Features

- **Pressure Loss Coefficient**: Parameter `kcham` defines the pressure loss coefficient within the combustion chamber.
- **Cross-sectional Area**: Parameter `Acham` represents the average cross-sectional area of the combustion chamber.
- **Thermal Losses**: Parameters `Xpth`, among others, capture thermal loss fractions and other losses related to unburnt particles.
- **Specific Heat Capacity**: Parameters like `Cpcd` allow specification of specific heat capacities for various substances.
- **Fuel and Air Properties**: The model allows defining fuel and air properties, including specific enthalpies, mass fractions, and compositions.

## Parameters

- **Combustion Chamber Properties**:
  - `kcham`: Pressure loss coefficient.
  - `Acham`: Cross-sectional area.
  - `Xpth`: Thermal loss fraction.
  - `ImbCV`: Unburnt particles ratio in volatile ashes.
  - `ImbBF`: Unburnt particles ratio in low furnace ashes.
  - `Cpcd`: Ashes specific heat capacity.

- **Atomic Mass Constants**:
  - Constants like `amC`, `amH`, `amO`, `amS` represent the atomic masses of fundamental combustion elements.

- **Fuel Properties**:
  - Fuel parameters such as `Qfuel`, `Tfuel`, `XCfuel`, and `LHVfuel` define its mass flow rate, temperature, carbon mass fraction, and lower heating value, respectively.

- **Air and Steam Properties**:
  - Defines air and steam mass flows, pressures, and specific enthalpies at the inlets using variables such as `Qea`, `Pea`, and `Hews`.

## Equations

- **Mass Balance**: Ensures mass conservation across the chamber.
- **Energy Balance**: Ensures energy conservation and quantifies energy conversion efficiency.
- **Pressure Drop**: Calculates pressure loss using `deltaPccb`.
- **Mass Fractions**: Models the formation of CO2, H2O, O2, and SO2 during combustion.

## Connectors

- **Cfuel (Fuel Inlet)**: Connects to the fuel source.
- **Ca (Air Inlet)**: Connects to the air supply.
- **Cfg (Flue Gases Outlet)**: Connects to the outlet for flue gases.
- **Cws (Water/Steam Inlet)**: Connects to the water or steam supply.

## Usage

The `GenericCombustion` model is designed for integration into larger thermal systems simulations. It can be used to evaluate combustion efficiency, pressure losses, and to optimize the combustion process for a given fuel and air mixture. This model serves as a foundational component in thermodynamic studies, enabling detailed analysis and optimization of energy systems. 

Developed as part of the ThermoSysPro library by EDF, the model is suitable for educational, research, and industrial applications in energy systems engineering.
